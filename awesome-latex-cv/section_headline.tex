{\textbf{Bio.}}

I completed my PhD at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay,
India, in aerospace engineering department. During my doctoral
studies, my research interests were centered on the application of
mesh-free methods to solve partial differential equations. After my
doctoral studies, I worked as an EPSRC Postdoctoral researcher at the
University of Surrey in Guildford, United Kingdom. My research at
University of Surrey primarily revolved around the investigation of
particle dispersion and mixing within stirring tanks, employing
computational techniques. Where, particle dispersion, swelling and
agglomeration was studied. Currently, I am working as a postdoctoral
at IIT Delhi, where I am studying second life batteries, dendrite
formation and capacity reduction.

I use smoothed particle hydrodynamics, discrete element method, and
finite element modeling to study these problems. Where I develop codes
which are heterogeneous in structure and can scale to exa-scale systems.


{\textbf{Research interests.}} My research work covers a range of
topics: \textbf{Meshless methods}: Smoothed particle hydrodynamics,
Discrete element method, Finite element method, High-performance
computing, ExaScale computing, Rigid-fluid coupling, Fluid-structure
interaction, Elastic-plastic modeling, Particle dispersion, Cohesive
materials.
