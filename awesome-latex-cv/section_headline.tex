{\textbf{Bio.}}

I am currently employed as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Surrey
in Guildford, United Kingdom. My research primarily revolves around the
investigation of particle dispersion and mixing within stirring tanks, employing
computational techniques. Previously, I completed my PhD at the Indian Institute
of Technology, Bombay, India, under the guidance of Prof. Prabhu
Ramachandran. During my doctoral studies, my research interests were centered on
the application of mesh-free methods to solve partial differential equations.


{\textbf{Research interests.}} My research work covers a range of topics:
\textbf{Meshless methods}: Smoothed particle hydrodynamics, Discrete element
method, High-performance computing, Rigid-fluid coupling, Fluid-structure
interaction, Elastic-plastic modeling, Particle dispersion, Cohesive materials.
