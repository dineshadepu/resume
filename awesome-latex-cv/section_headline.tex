{\textbf{Bio.}}

I completed my PhD at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, India, under
the guidance of Prof. Prabhu Ramachandran. During my doctoral studies, my
research interests were centered on the application of mesh-free methods to
solve partial differential equations. After my doctoral studies, I worked as an
EPSRC Postdoctoral researcher at the University of Surrey in Guildford, United
Kingdom with Prof. Chuan-Yu Wu. My research at University of Surrey primarily
revolved around the investigation of particle dispersion and mixing within
stirring tanks, employing computational techniques. Where, particle dispersion,
swelling and agglomeration was studied.


{\textbf{Research interests.}} My research work covers a range of topics:
\textbf{Meshless methods}: Smoothed particle hydrodynamics, Discrete element
method, High-performance computing, ExaScale computing, Rigid-fluid coupling,
Fluid-structure interaction, Elastic-plastic modeling, Particle dispersion,
Cohesive materials.
