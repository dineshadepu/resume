    {} {
                      \begin{itemize}
                      \item Developed a corrected transport velocity formulation in SPH to model
                        fluid and elastic dynamics.
                      \item The solver is developed in PySPH % (link{https://github.com/pypr/pysph}{PySPH})
                      \item Fully reproducible and open source. (\link{https://gitlab.com/pypr/ctvf}{Code link})

  {} {
                      \begin{itemize}
                      \item  A contact force model incorporated into an updated-Lagrangian SPH is developed.
                      \item  Unphysical interaction of the elastic solids within the classical SPH is eliminated.
                      \item  The method can easily handle friction between two solids.
                      \item  A careful investigation of primary and secondary bodies is conducted.
                      \item  Several numerical examples are utilized to confirm the proposed model.
                      \item  The source code is made available under an open source license.
