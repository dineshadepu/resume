  {} {A corrected transport-velocity formulation for fluid and structural mechanics with SPH}{}{}
  {}    {
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Developed a corrected transport velocity formulation in SPH to model
      fluid and elastic dynamics.
    \item The solver is developed in PySPH % (link{https://github.com/pypr/pysph}{PySPH})
    \item Fully reproducible and open source. (\link{https://gitlab.com/pypr/ctvf}{Code link})

  {} {Elastic bodies collision with SPH-DEM coupling}{}{}
  {}    {
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Oct-Dec 2011, \emph{Online Works Show Platform} | \emph{Leader}. I designed and implemented a lightweight
      relational object JDBC package, which is used for the programming of the server.
      Got the 2\textsuperscript{nd} place of the contest judged by the TaoBao UED.

    \item Nov 2011, \emph{Unix File System} | \emph{Independent developer}. The system is implemented by the C/C++. It has basic shell commands, well performed
      memory management,  as well as the users management, and it supports parallel operation.

  {Dec 2012 }    {
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Apply the GMM, student-t mixture model, and Dirichlet process based infinite mixture modelto the brain MR image clustering problem;
    \item Derive the detail variational Bayesian inference process.
    \item Improve these three algorithms by using laplacian graph (manifold learning);
